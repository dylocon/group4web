<!-- 
Delete users from the Database
Follow the link I gave you  for help
https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_update.asp
You need the $_SESSION['userID] Variable to get the ID of the user you want to update.
You need $_POST['firstName'], $_POST['lastName'] and $_POST['Role'] for the details you will update them with
Look at all the other php files with SQL on them if you need a reference to what it should look like and where you should put the variables.
