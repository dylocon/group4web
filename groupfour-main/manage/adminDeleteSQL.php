<!-- 
Delete users from the Database
Follow the link I gave you  for help
https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_delete.asp
You need the $_GET['userID] Variable to get the ID of the user you want to delete
Look at all the other php files with SQL on them if you need a reference to what it should look like.
